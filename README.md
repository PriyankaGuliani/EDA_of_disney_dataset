# EDA of Disney Dataset
## Exploratory Data Analysis of the Disney datasets
This notebook will be showing some exploratory data analysis for the DISNEY dataset located at https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16.
## Question(s) of interests
* Which genre of Disney movies is the most popular? To answer this question, I will determine the genre in which the maximum number of movies have been produced and which genre has generated the highest gross income for Disney.
* Find out which of the five subsidiaries of Disney generates the maximum revenue and which of these seems to be a promising source of revenue in the future.
## Repository Contents
The repository contains the following files: 
* **Disney_Analysis.ipynb**: a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code used for the analysis.
* **my_functions.py**: Functions used for Data Transformation as per the requirements
* **test_my_functions.py**: unit test cases for script.py with helper data data/disney_movies.csv: a CSV file containing the raw data used for the analysis.
* **data/disney_movies_total_gross.csv**: a CSV file containing the raw data used for the analysis.
* **data/disney_revenue_1991-2016.csv**:  a CSV file containing the raw data used for the analysis.
* **README.md**: this file.
## Running the Code
To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you'll need to install several Python libraries, including pandas, and altair. You can install these libraries using pip or conda. Once you have the libraries installed, you can open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to reproduce the analysis.
